# ðŸ“˜ PostgreSQL Notes

Hey there ðŸ‘‹  
This repo is all about my learning journey with **PostgreSQL**.  
Iâ€™ve added my notes, examples, and queries in a way thatâ€™s easy to follow for beginners (and useful as a quick reference for pros too ðŸ˜‰).

### ðŸ“Œ Whatâ€™s Inside?
- âœ… Basics (databases, tables, CRUD)  
- âœ… Keys, relationships, and constraints  
- âœ… Joins & subqueries explained with examples  
- âœ… Views, triggers, and stored procedures  
- âœ… Indexing & optimization tricks  
- âœ… Advanced stuff like CTEs and window functions  

### ðŸŽ¯ Why I Made This
- To **learn PostgreSQL step by step**  
- To **help beginners** who want a simple reference  
- To keep a **cheat sheet** I can use anytime  

### ðŸ’¡ How to Use
